          <h3>Hang in there, you're almost there!</h3>
          <p>We hope this one is obvious but, at the Bureau, respect and consent is absolutely essential. We welcome guests of any gender, racial, ethnic, sexual, age, class identity, political beliefs, hair styles, and  and want everyone to be able to express themselves fully, feeling free to engage in creative, collaborative participation. <strong>We have a zero tolerance policy for any kind of harassment, and when you commit to buying a ticket, we trust that you understand and support this outlook. </strong>Similarly we do encourage you all to go bonkers, but know your limits, and ensure that your actions don't negatively affect others.</p>
          <p>The festival site is gorgeous, and we aim to keep it that way; for ourselves, and for the ones who follow. We'll have an appropriate amount of bins on site, and everything that is waste must end up in them. This especially applies to cigarette butts. There are no excuses for this, it is a fire risk. Bring a tin or an ashtray and if you need one, we will provide one. The same applies to all types of open flame - candles, camping stoves, BBQ's, fireworks - please leave them at home.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we'd like to mention that the Playground Bureau is a non-profit enterprise, and therefore all proceeds are reinvested into the community to foster creativity and build new events and ideas. Let's build a sustainably enjoyable event where the community energy is renewable and the environment is left better than when we arrived. Like an island, or a spaceship full of monkeys.</p>

                These guidelines are clear, and I appreciate that they are in effect for a good and positive reason. I commit to upholding these essentials, and understand that if I don't, then I will be asked to leave the festival.
