            This should go without saying, but at the Bureau, respect and consent is absolutely essential. We welcome guests of any gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, age, class identity, political beliefs, hair style, dance move preferences, you name it. Everyone should be able to express themselves fully, feeling free to engage in creative, collaborative participation. <strong>We have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY for any kind of harassment, and when you commit to buying a ticket, we trust that you understand and support this outlook. </strong>Similarly, we <em>do</em> encourage you all to go bonkers, but know your limits. Make sure your fun doesn't come at someone else's expense. Basically, don't be a fu<span class="redacted-text">[REDACTED BY BUREAU COMMUNICATION CENSORING OFFICE]</span>.

            This year's farm is a gorgeous site, and we aim to keep it that way; both for ourselves and for the ones who follow (and also so we don't lose our deposit).

              <li>Bins will be everywhere, so use them! Everything that is waste <strong>must</strong> end up in them.</li>
              <li>Cigarette butts are a serious <strong>fire hazard</strong> on top of being harmful for the environment. Bring a tin or an ashtray. If you need one, we will provide one.</li>
              <li><strong>No open flames</strong>. This includes candles, camping stoves, BBQs, fireworks. Leave them at home. No exceptions!</li>
            </ul>

            Additionally, we'd like to mention that the Playground Bureau is a Non-Profit Cultural Association (under the name Associació per a la Promoció dels Enllaços Socials — A.P.E.S.), and therefore all proceeds are reinvested into the community to foster creativity and build new events and ideas. Since this gathering is formally a private members-only event, your ticket fee is actually a membership contribution to our association — by securing your spot, <strong>you will automatically become a temporary member of the association for the duration of the festival and the month that follows.</strong> (hence why we will ask you for your ID number during registration). Come hang out after the festival, piece together your time with other festival-goers, and join us for whatever else we're doing!

                These guidelines are clear, and I appreciate that they are in effect for a good and positive reason. I commit to upholding these essentials, and understand that if I don't, then <strong>I will be asked to leave the festival.</strong>
