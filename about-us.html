        Founded in 2023 and based in Barcelona, Playground Bureau is a non-profit institution dedicated to creating fun parties and experiences.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As suggested by our cutting-edge website, we are a very serious organization.
        Our top mathematicians are frantically developing formulas to recognize 'good old days' while we're still in them.
        Meanwhile, our vibe engineers work night and day to bring you events with the best possible atmosphereâ€”safe, inclusive, and so trustworthy you could leave your phone unattended and find it right where you left it (please don't try this). Our events are invite-only, as the Bureau believes that the people who come create the party, not just the planners and DJs. We like to think we're giving a run for their money to our competitors, Google and Carrefour.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We proudly collaborate with our sister collective, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/noconcerns_/">No Concerns</a>, in Lithuania.
