            <p>
              Good morning! Or good afternoon! or good evening! depending on where you are! God damn it! seems like the Syndicate has replaced all the punctuation marks on our word processors with exclamation marks! There we go, it's fixed. Sorry about that. It's non-stop monkey business at the Bureau, you know how it is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyways! We are thrilled, and we mean thrilled, to announce the first installation of the Bureau's hundred-year annual program where the following items will be rigorously field-tested for optimal production of Goodtimes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sound waves that makes you dance way past your bedtime
              </li>
              <li>
                (but you still feel decently fresh the next day, somehow)
              </li>
              <li>
                Technology that transforms small talks into medium talks and maybe even into some big talks!
              </li>
              <li>
                Space where daily concerns can be forgotten, just for a little while
              </li>
              <li>
                Lots of workshops to practice more of what you love or try something new
              </li>
              <li>
                Really tasty meals cooked by wonderful people with amor
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              And so and so forth! You get the idea. The Bureau's Office of Making Sure Eveyrone Has the Best Possible Time is working tirelessly to create an environment where all two hundred of us can generate sufficient levels of Goodtimesium to last us through the winter. And if our calculations are correct, the Goodtimesium half-life should extend well into your return to normal life, spreading it to your friends, family, and coworkers like radioactive glitter.
            </p>
            <p>
              As long as we could evade any disruptions from the Playground Syndicate, everything should go smoothly as planned, and nothing will go wrong :) So Lelt's make some memories together, come join us for a weekend of dancing, laughing, learning, dancing some more, and creating a community of kindness and love for 3 days.

            <p class="section-title"><strong>üó∫Ô∏è MAP üó∫Ô∏è</strong></p>
            <p>We really want to show you pictures of the beautiful location! But we can't! It's a secretive venue, and we respect the owners' intention to keep the place as under-the-radar as possible. So here is a photorealistic depiction of what the site will look like:</p>

            <p class="section-title"><strong>üåÄ WORKSHOPS & ACTIVITIES üåÄ</strong></p>
            We're not gonna be blasting four-to-the-floor mid-day. Instead, we have a bunch of workshops and activities for you to enjoy to the backdrop of the beautiful hills and forests. Here are some of the things you can expect:

            <p>Art Therapy</p>

            <p>Blackout Poetry</p>
            <p>Contact Improv</p>
            <p>Dance Ritual</p>
            <p>Erotic Ecology</p>
            <p>M.M.M.M.</p>
            <p>Mystical Mixology</p>
            <p>Morning Yoga</p>

            <p>Tattoo Parlor</p>
            <p>and more</p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-title"><strong>üöó ACCESS üöó</strong></p>
            <p>The festival is around an hour's drive from Barcelona and there will be plenty of on-site parking. Alternatively, you can travel by train to Terrassa and then take a taxi to and from the event (less than 20 minutes, less than 20 euros).<br></p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-title"><strong>ü•ò FOOD ü•ò</strong></p>
            <p>Freshly made food will be provided four times during the festival by the Bureau's Department of Feeding Hungry Souls.  However you are still advised to bring <em>some</em> supplies with you, like light snacks, fruits and things to keep you going for breakfast, and while the kitchen is closed.<br></p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-title"><strong>ü•ò DRINKS ü•ò</strong></p>
            <p>We're asking each of you to contribute your favorite bottle of alcohol, soft drink, or a creative combo of both to our communal bar. Don't worry, we'll also stock up on water, soft drinks, popular spirits, and some beers. Once we're all set up, drinks will be on the house ‚Äî no checks, no charges, no need to carry coins! But that doesn't mean we endorse getting absolutely bananas-drunk. Please enjoy responsibly :)<br></p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-title"><strong>üèïÔ∏è SLEEPING üèïÔ∏è</strong></p>
            <p>Please bring a tent! We have a couple areas where you can camp. The campsites aren't right next to the dancefloors, so you should get good sleep at night! Which also means: make noise at the party areas and respect the sleepers! Vans and vehicle camping are also welcomed ‚Äî there is a limited capacity for camping vehicles so please email us and secure a space. </p>
