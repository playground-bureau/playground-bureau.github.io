                  Good morning! or good afternoon! or good evening depending on where you are! God damn it! seems like the Syndicate has replaced all the punctuation marks on our word processors with exclamation marks! There we go, fixed it. Sorry about that. It's non-stop monkey business at the Bureau, you know how it is.
                </p>

              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <p>
                  Anyways! We are thrilled, and we mean thrilled, to announce the first installation of the Bureau's hundred-year annual program where the following items will be rigorously field-tested for optimal production of Goodtimes:
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <ul>
                  <li>Sound waves that makes you dance way past your bedtime</li>
                  <li>(but you still feel decently fresh the next day, somehow)</li>
                  <li>Technology that transforms small talks into medium talks and maybe even into some big talks!</li>
                  <li>Space where daily concerns can be forgotten, just for a little while</li>
                  <li>Lots of workshops to practice more of what you love or try something new</li>
                  <li>Really tasty meals cooked by wonderful people with amor</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <p>
                  And so and so forth! You get the idea. The Bureau's Office of Making Sure Eveyrone Has the Best Possible Time is working tirelessly to create an environment where all two hundred of us can generate sufficient levels of Goodtimesium to last us through the winter. And if our calculations are correct, the Goodtimesium half-life should extend well into your return to normal life, spreading it to your friends, family, and coworkers like radioactive glitter.
                </p>

                  As long as we could evade any disruptions from the Playground Syndicate, everything should go smoothly as planned, and nothing will go wrong :) So Let's make some memories together, come join us for a weekend of dancing, laughing, learning, dancing some more, and creating a community of kindness and love for 3 days.

                Oh, and we're non-for-profit. So every cent you spend goes back into our events. The tickets include a spot to pitch a tent or park your van, workshops, activities, two nights of music, 4 rounds of food, and an open bar (really!? that's all included!? yes, see below for more info). Here are the prices:
              </div>
              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <ul class="ticket-list">
                  <li><del>Fruit Growing From the Ground (Presale) - 90 euros</del> <span class="sold-out"><em>SOLD OUT</em></span></li>
                  <li><del>Low-Hanging Fruit (1st release) - 105 euros</del> <span class="sold-out"><em>SOLD OUT</em></span></li>
                  <li>Hanging Fruit (2nd release) - 120 euros <span class="sold-out"><em>SELLING OUT</em></span></li>
                  <li>Fruit (3rd release) - 135 euros</li>
                  <li>High-Hanging Fruit (Final Release) - 150 euros</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="festival-info-block">
                  The idea is that you wouldn't have to spend a single cent at the event since everything is included. (Only exceptions are getting a tattoo or visiting a pop-up shop.)
