            <p>Dust off your briefcase, shred up those spreadsheets, and let's go bananas. It's Monkey Business at the Playground Bureau's inaugural festival event just outside of Barcelona.</p>
            <p>It will be interactive, it will be entertaining, it will be surreal. We are leveraging all of our bureau resources to create something which is fresh, theatrical, and allows as much or as little participation as desired, by you and each of our two hundred guests.</p>
            <p>We are here to mix business with pleasure once and for all, and we'd like you to get in at the ground level.<strong><br></strong></p>

            <p>Freshly made food will be provided four times during the festival by the Bureau's Department of Feeding Hungry Souls.  However you are still advised to bring <em>some</em> supplies with you, like light snacks, fruits and things to keep you going for breakfast, and while the kitchen is closed.<br></p>
            <br>
