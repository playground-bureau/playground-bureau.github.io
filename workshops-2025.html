              <p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> Alexa</p>
              <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 90 minutes</p>
              <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 30</p>
              <p class="workshop-description">
                Step inside the Bureau of Botanical Experimentation, where participants become undercover herbal agents conducting vital research on the mysterious substance known as Goodtimesium. In this interactive and absurdly scientific experience, agents will choose between three experimental protocols: creating a powdered herbal infusion (The SIP), crafting a magical mocktail (The SPLASH), or blending a custom herbal smoke (The PUFF). With stamps, secret codenames, and questionable lab props, this is part potion lab, part festival silliness, and all botanical joy. No experience necessaryâ€”just curiosity and a willingness to play.

              <p class="workshop-description">
                This workshop is a guided journey into your emotional depth and embodied aliveness.
                Through somatic practices, intuitive movement, guided meditation, deep dialogue and sacred witnessing, you are invited to slow down and soften â€” to open space for everything that is alive in you.
                It's not about striving or fixing. It's an invitation to listen more deeply â€” and let your body lead the way.
                You may reconnect with parts of yourself that have been quiet for a while. In movement and stillness. In sound and silence.
                This is a space for truth, connection, and embodied presence.
                A space to land â€” and gently return to yourself.
                Come as you are. Let whatever wants to move, move.

            <h3>Contact Improvisation: Gravity's Playground</h3>
            <div class="workshop-details">
              <p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> Sara</p>
              <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 120 minutes</p>
              <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 25</p>
              <p class="workshop-description">
                In this introductory Contact Improvisation workshop, we explore the foundational principles of the form through embodied metaphorsâ€”images and sensations that awaken natural movement and deepen our connection with gravity, touch, and shared momentum.<br><br>
                We will learn basic skills such as rolling point of contact, weight sharing, following/falling, and active listening through simple improvisational scores. But rather than focusing only on technique, we'll activate the body's imaginationâ€”becoming sponges, animals, liquids, roots, or windâ€”to access movement qualities that are intuitive, playful, and grounded.<br><br>
                Each metaphor acts as a bridge between physical technique and inner sensation, helping participants to discover movement organically, stay present, and develop trust in both themselves and their partners.

                Step into the mystical realm of Tarot as we invite you to join our circle for an introductory exploration of the symbols and cycles represented within the cards.

                Our gathering will begin with a grounding meditation before we dive into the cycles and elements that thread through both our lives and the tarot's rich symbolism. Together, we unravel the mysteries and messages of the cards, cultivating a solid foundation for interpreting their evocative imagery.<br><br>
                Whether you're a curious newcomer or a seasoned seeker, all are welcome in our circle. No prior experience with tarot is necessary, though you're invited to bring along your own deck if you have one.

              <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 10</p>
              <p class="workshop-description">
                Step off the beaten path and into the mysterious world beneath the trees.
                Join me for a guided mushroom foraging walk!<br><br>
                Together, we'll explore the fascinating role mushrooms play in our ecosystems â€“ from decomposition to symbiosis â€“ and meet a variety of wild fungi along the trail. You'll learn how to observe, identify, and connect with the forest in a whole new way.<br><br>
                ðŸ§  <strong>This workshop is about knowledge, not consumption:</strong>
                While edible mushrooms often spark the most curiosity, the focus here is on learning. We'll talk about the risks, myths, and responsible foraging practices â€“ and yes, we'll also cover which species are considered edible in this region and how to recognize them. However, this is not a cooking class or a harvest-based activity.<br><br>
                <strong>About me:</strong>
                I'm a self-taught mushroom enthusiast with years of experience exploring and researching fungi. From medicinal to edible mushrooms, psychedelic to deadly toxic, the fungal kingdom has so much to offer and teach us.
                For me, this journey is a never-ending one â€“ full of curiosity, continuous learning, and awe for the natural world.<br><br>
                Come with open eyes and an open mind â€“ and let the forest surprise you.
