          <h3>Welcome back to the Playground Bur… just one thing real quick.</h3>
          <p>
            We're stoked to see that you've decided to participate in <strong>Monkey
            Business 2: Where the Goodtimes Bloom</strong>. It's going to be a blast, and we honestly can't wait to
            welcome you back into our world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the music, the loopy theatrics, the cows, the exterior-indooritorium, and the bright lights—<strong>our community is the festival</strong>. It's what makes this experience special.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, before you snag that ticket and officially join the fun, here's a swift breakdown of some things that really matter to us all.
