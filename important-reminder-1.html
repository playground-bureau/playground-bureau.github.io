          <h3>Welcome to the Playground Burâ€¦ just one thing real quick.</h3>
          <p>
            We're stoked to see that you've decided to participate in Monkey
            Business. It's going to be a blast, and we honestly can't wait to
            welcome you into our world.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'd like to take this opportunity to emphasise that beyond the
            music and merriment, bright lights, and hare-brained theatrics,
            <strong>our community is the festival.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We want you to be part of the best festival possible, so just before
            you snag a ticket and officially join the Bureau community, we'd
            like you to read a swift breakdown of some things that are really
            important for us all.
          </p>
