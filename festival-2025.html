                  We're beyond thrilled to announce the second installation of <em>Meticulously Orchestrated Neurokinetic Kontrolled Environment for the Yearly Boosting of Universal Sociability, Instilling Neighborly Euphoria, and Spreading Synergy.</em> When we learned that the first letters spell out M-O-N-K-E-Y B-U-S-I-N-E-S-S, we couldn't believe our luck. The Bureau mathematicians calculated the odds at 1 in 100 quintillion. We're not sure what that means, but it sounds pretty special.

                  1st edition was a big success, thanks to all of you. For the 2nd edition, we are doing 3 nights and 4 days. Yup, you heard that right. And we're going have 56 more participants than last year. We once again asked our mathematicians to crunch the numbers, and they've confirmed an 78.90% projected increase in joy and connection.

                  After extensive field research, our Bureau agronomists have discovered a rare deposit of Goodtimesium-rich soil in our new location. We're turning the entire festival grounds into an experimental fruit farm where we'll be growing and harvesting the most potent Goodtimesium-infused produce ever cultivated! A crucial step in stopping the spread of Separatonin.

                  By public transport, you can take the R6 from Plaça Espanya to Igualada, then take the taxi from there (around 20 euros).

                Freshly made food will be provided six times during the festival by the Bureau's Department of Feeding Hungry Souls, made up of great friends of ours who also happen to be professional and hobbyist chefs. However you are still advised to bring <em>some</em> supplies with you, like light snacks, fruits and things to keep you going for breakfast, and while the kitchen is closed.

                  We're asking each of you to contribute your favorite bottle of alcohol, soft drink, or a creative combo of both to our communal bar. Don't worry, we'll also stock up on water, soft drinks, popular spirits, and some beers. Once we're all set up, drinks will be on the house — no checks, no charges, no need to carry coins! But that doesn't mean we endorse getting absolutely bananas-drunk. Please enjoy responsibly :)

                  The much-acclaimed Tea House will be back this year! Tea House 2.0 will host workshops during the day and turn into a cozy lounge by the night. If the dance floor is too much for you, you can always come here to relax and make new friends. We'll also have plenty of drinking water available at the bar and the Tea House.

                  There's gonna be one evening during the festival where we kindly oblige you to dress up in a certain theme. We'll make sure it'll be something you can choose to go all out with or lightly participate in (though the former is recommended). We won't demand anything bat-shit crazy or require you to buy anything new. This will be announced a few months prior to the event!
