                  We're beyond thrilled to announce the second installation of Meticulously Orchestrated Neurokinetic Kontrolled Environment for the Yearly Boosting of Universal Sociability, Instilling Neighborly Euphoria, and Spreading Synergy. When we learned that the first letters spell out M-O-N-K-E-Y B-U-S-I-N-E-S-S, we couldn't believe our luck. The Bureau mathematicians calculated the odds at 1 in 100 quintillion. We're not sure what that means, but it sounds pretty special.

                  1st edition was a big success, thanks to all of you. For the 2nd edition, we are doing 3 nights and 4 days. Yup, you heard that right. And we're going have 56 more participants than last year. We once again asked our mathematicians to crunch the numbers, and they've confirmed an 78.90% projected increase in joy and connection.

                  After extensive field research, our Bureau agronomists have discovered a rare deposit of Goodtimesium-rich soil in our new location. We're turning the entire festival grounds into an experimental fruit farm where we'll be growing and harvesting the most potent Goodtimesium-infused produce ever cultivated!

                As a non-profit cultural association, your ticket is actually a membership contribution that goes directly to supporting our events. The tickets include a spot to pitch a tent or park your van, workshops, activities, 3 nights of music, wonderful company, 6 rounds of delicious food, and an open community bar (okay you've gotta be bullshitting, right? that's all included!? yes, see below for more info). Here are the prices:

                  The idea is that you wouldn't have to spend a single onsite since everything is included. (Only exceptions are special side activities like massage)

                Freshly made food will be provided six times during the festival by the Bureau's Department of Feeding Hungry Souls, made up of great friends of ours who also happen to be professional and hobbyist chefs. However you are still advised to bring <em>some</em> supplies with you, like light snacks, fruits and things to keep you going for breakfast, and while the kitchen is closed.

                We're asking each of you to contribute your favorite bottle of alcohol, soft drink, or a creative combo of both to our communal bar. Don't worry, we'll also stock up on water, soft drinks, popular spirits, and some beers. Once we're all set up, drinks will be on the house ‚Äî no checks, no charges, no need to carry coins! But that doesn't mean we endorse getting absolutely bananas-drunk. Please enjoy responsibly :)

                Tea will also be available at the Tea House, where the workshops will be held during the day and ambient and chill music will be played at night. If the dance floor is too much for you, you can always come here to relax and make new friends. We'll also have plenty of drinking water available at the bar and the Tea House.
