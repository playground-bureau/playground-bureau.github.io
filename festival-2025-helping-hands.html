                  Welcome to the super top secret <strong>Playground Bureau Helping Hands Program!</strong> Great work passing the tricky first challenge (clicking the instantgarm link), it's all downhill from here. Before you jump in and get your hands deliciously dirty in the Goodtimesium fields at Monkey Business 2.0, here's what you need to know about how we select helpers, what we're looking for, and how your contributions impact your festival experience.
                </p>

              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <div class="section-title d-flex-center">üî¨ THE HIGHLY SCIENTIFIC SELECTION PROCESS üî¨</div>
                <p>
                  We have a <strong>set number of helper spots available</strong>, and we're looking for folks who are excited to contribute and bring great energy to the experience. Here's what we're looking for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Availability:</strong> It's a lot easier to help if you're at the festival on the days it's happening!</li>
                  <li><strong>Experience & Skills:</strong> Got experience in food prep, event support, logistics, or wrangling small (or large) chaotic situations? Awesome! Not required, but super helpful.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> If you sign up, we're counting on you to show up and be present. It's a team effort, and when one person flakes, it impacts everyone.</li>
                  <li><strong>Team Spirit:</strong> This is a crew effort. We need people who bring good vibes, adaptability, and a willingness to roll with the unexpected.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <div class="section-title d-flex-center">üåø WHAT WE EXPECT FROM YOU üåø</div>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show up on time</strong> for your shift. Your fellow helpers and festival-goers are counting on you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be adaptable:</strong> festival environments can be unpredictable, and flexibility is key.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect the space, the people, and the process.</strong> We're all here to create something special together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Take initiative:</strong> If you see something that needs doing, jump in! There's always room for a helping hand.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="section-title d-flex-center">üçå WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM US üçå</div>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Half priced tickets</strong> for the festival - this includes all meals and unlimited drinks!</li>
                    <li><strong>One on-call shift</strong> during the festival (you'll be part of a team led by a core crew member).</li>
                    <li><strong>2-5 hours of actual work</strong> spread across that day. You'll need to be available and around, we'll make sure you're not overloaded, and once your shift is up, that's it!</li>
                    <li>A <strong>core team member</strong> will be there to guide you and make sure everything stays manageable.</li>
                    <li>You'll never be left overwhelmed‚Äî<strong>if things get busy, we'll call in extra help!</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>It's a music festival, which means the unexpected will happen (I mean, it's called Monkey Business‚Ä¶), and we'll need to stay responsive. That's where the <strong>core team lead</strong> comes in‚Äîto help adapt the plan and make sure everyone's looked after.</p>
                  <p>But, here are a few of the roles you can expect to fill:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kitchen Creators:</strong> Prepping, chopping, and cooking up delicious meals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food Couriers:</strong> Delivering meals from kitchen to hungry revellers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cleanup Crew:</strong> Keeping the facilities running smoothly with good vibes and clean surfaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Receiving deliveries:</strong> such as ice for the bar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Being a point of contact:</strong> if a festival goer feels unwell, or wants to talk</li>
                    <li><strong>Bar staff:</strong> Keep our thirsty dancers going through the night.</li>
                  </ul>
