                  Welcome to the super top secret <strong>Playground Bureau Helping Hands Program!</strong> Great work passing the tricky first challenge (clicking the instantgarm link), it's all downhill from here. Before you jump in and get your hands deliciously dirty in the Goodtimesium fields at Monkey Business 2.0, here's what you need to know about how we select helpers, what we're looking for, and how your contributions impact your festival experience.
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">ðŸ”¬ THE HIGHLY SCIENTIFIC SELECTION PROCESS ðŸ”¬</div>
                <p>
                  We have a <strong>set number of helper spots available</strong>, and we're looking for folks who are excited to contribute and bring great energy to the experience. Here's what we're looking for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Availability:</strong> It's a lot easier to help if you're at the festival on the days it's happening!</li>
                  <li><strong>Experience & Skills:</strong> Got experience in food prep, event support, logistics, or wrangling small (or large) chaotic situations? Awesome! Not required, but super helpful.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> If you sign up, we're counting on you to show up and be present. It's a team effort, and when one person flakes, it impacts everyone.</li>
                  <li><strong>Team Spirit:</strong> This is a crew effort. We need people who bring good vibes, adaptability, and a willingness to roll with the unexpected.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <div class="section-title">ðŸŒ¿ WHAT WE EXPECT FROM YOU ðŸŒ¿</div>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Show up on time</strong> for your shift. Your fellow helpers and festival-goers are counting on you.</li>
                  <li><strong>Be adaptable:</strong> festival environments can be unpredictable, and flexibility is key.</li>
                  <li><strong>Respect the space, the people, and the process.</strong> We're all here to create something special together.</li>
                  <li><strong>Take initiative:</strong> If you see something that needs doing, jump in! There's always room for a helping hand.</li>
                </ul>
