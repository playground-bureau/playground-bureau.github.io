                <div class="section-title d-flex-center">Why We're Building This</div>
                <p>In an era built for speed, for work, for endless scrolling and spending and scrolling again, we are choosing something else.</p>
                <p>We are building HQ: a home for community in Barcelona.</p>
                <p>A real space for gathering. For being human together — without an algorithm measuring it, without a feed monetizing it, without a brand packaging it.</p>
                <p>Because the truth is: we are more connected than ever, and somehow lonelier than ever.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Globally, nearly 1 in 4 people feel very or fairly lonely — over a billion individuals. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/512618/almost-quarter-world-feels-lonely.aspx">(Gallup, 2024)</a></li>
                  <li>In Spain, 20% of the population reports frequent loneliness, with 13.5% living with it for more than two years. <a href="https://www.soledades.es/sites/default/files/contenidos/Resumen_Ejecutivo_Baro%CC%81metro_Soledades_Ingle%CC%81s_v02.pdf">(Soledades.es, 2023)</a></li>
                  <li>In Barcelona, young people (16-24) report higher loneliness rates (26.5%) than even seniors over 65. <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/dretssocials/sites/default/files/arxius-documents/barcelona_loneliness_strategy_2020_2030.pdf">(Ajuntament de Barcelona)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This isn't a personal failing.</p>
                <p>It's the logical result of a world designed to separate us, distract us, and monetize every spare moment of our attention.</p>

              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <div class="section-title d-flex-center">The Problems We See</div>
                <p class="underline">Too much scrolling</p>
                <p>We scroll more than we speak. We doom-scroll, shop-scroll, rage-scroll — numbing ourselves while reaching for something we can't name. What gets lost is real presence, real connection, real time.</p>
                <p class="underline">The Illusion of Connection</p>
                <p>Social media promises us community and delivers only more isolation. We have more “friends” than ever, and fewer people to call when it matters. Visibility has replaced belonging.</p>
                <p class="underline">Distraction</p>
                <p>The systems we live in profit most when we are isolated, anxious, and endlessly “engaged.” Loneliness isn't an accident — it's a feature.</p>
                <p class="underline">Progress at All Costs</p>
                <p>The ideology of “more, faster, newer” tells us that being still, being together, being slow is a waste of time. But what if the real waste is letting another year pass without building anything real?</p>

              <div class="festival-info-block">
                <div class="section-title d-flex-center">What HQ Is</div>
                <p>HQ is a real, physical space for gathering — not mediated through screens, not for sale, not for spectacle.</p>
                <p>It's for:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dinners without an end time.</li>
                  <li>Conversations that stretch into the night.</li>
                  <li>Workshops, rituals, tiny raves, project labs.</li>
                  <li>Crying sessions. Potlucks. Strange experiments.</li>
                  <li>Building projects, dreams, and communities outside of algorithms and profit margins.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It will be messy. It will be slow.</p>
                <p>It will be deeply human.</p>
                <p>It will be run by the cultural association A.P.E.S., but shaped by everyone who shows up.</p>

              <div class="section-title d-flex-center">Why It Matters</div>
              <p>We believe that creating spaces for collective care, creativity, and connection is not a luxury.</p>
              <p>It's a necessity.</p>
              <br>
              <p>A space like HQ isn't a “nice to have” — it's a quiet act of resistance against a world that wants us isolated, overworked, and distracted.</p>
              <br>
              <p>HQ is not a product.</p>
              <p>It's not optimized.</p>
              <p>It's not scalable.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It's a seed.</p>
              <p>A place to remember how to be with each other — in real time, in real rooms, with real laughter, real grief, real joy, real mess.</p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <div class="festival-info-block">
              <div class="section-title d-flex-center">How You Can Support</div>
              <p>If you feel the same, there are ways to help make this place a reality:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Donate: Help us open the doors.</li>
                <li>Spread the Word: Invite people who need this too.</li>
                <li>Volunteer: Build, paint, cook, dream with us.</li>
                <li>Pitch Ideas: Workshops, labs, gatherings, anything weird and real.</li>
                <li>Show Up: That's it. Show up, and bring your whole self.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>Magic's already happening. We're just building a place to catch it.</p>
